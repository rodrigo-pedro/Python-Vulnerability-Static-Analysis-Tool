# Python Vulnerability Static Analysis Tool

Python static analysis tool for identifying data information flow violations. University project for the Software Security course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (2022).

Identifies data flows from sources to sinks in a Python program, based on a set of patterns that define sources, sinks, and sanitizers. Takes in a JSON file with the program's AST and another JSON file with the patterns to look for. Outputs a JSON file with the results of the analysis.

See the [project statement](project_statement.pdf) for more information. Also see the [report](report.pdf) for a detailed explanation of the tool's implementation.

## Running the tool

```sh
python ./parser.py program.json patterns.json
```
